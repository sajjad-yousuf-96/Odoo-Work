<h3>Writing code with Python</h3>
The primary programming language of Odoo is Python. Like the other technologies underlying Odoo, the Python language is open source and runs on all the major contemporary operating systems.

<h3>Following the Model-View-Controller design</h3>
Odoo is built upon a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. One of the primary goals of this architecture is to separate the visual display of the information from the business rules and management of the underlying data.

<h3>Designing models</h3>
he model is essentially the data that makes up your Odoo installation, which is stored in the PostgreSQL database. Odoo is unique in that database structures are typically defined by the Odoo modules at the time they are installed.

<h3>Rendering views</h3>
Each view in Odoo is defined in XML documents. The Odoo framework is responsible for rendering these view files in a web browser. 

<h3>Authoring controllers</h3>
The controller component of the architecture is where the business logic and workflow rules of the Odoo application are applied
